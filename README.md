# My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Plain Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

I learnt that no two project are build thesame way. and also that the more you build, the more you learn.. 

Keep things as simple as it can be.  

Commenting things out and adding borders Will give you a clear picture. And also help you see what elements are out of place and how a little teak will make it better.
